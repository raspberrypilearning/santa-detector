## PIR Motion Sensors

A PIR Motion Sensor is a component that can be used to detect when a warm body (like a human or an animal) is moving. You can read more about PIR Motion Sensors in the section below.

Before you connect your PIR Motion Sensor to your Raspberry Pi, you might need to tune it, so that it will work with this project.

- Have a look at the section below, to learn how to tune your PIR Motion Sensor correctly.

- Now you will need to connect your PIR Motion Sensor to your Raspberry Pi. Read the section below, and connect your PIR Motion Sensor so that the **OUT** pin is connected to the GP4 pin of your Raspberry Pi. Make sure you look at the labels on the PIR Motion Sensor, so that you know which pin is which.
