## PIR motion sensors

A passive infrared (PIR) motion sensor is a component that you can use to detect when a warm body (like a human or an animal) is moving. You can read more about PIR motion sensors in the section below.

You might need to tune your PIR sensor so that it will work with this project.

- Have a look at the section below to learn how to tune your PIR sensor correctly.

- You will want to turn both potentiometers fully anti-clockwise for this project.

- Now you need to connect your PIR sensor to your Raspberry Pi. Read the section below, and connect your sensor so that the **OUT** pin is connected to the **GPIO 4** pin of your Pi. **Look at the labels on the sensor to check which pin is which. You may have to lift off the cap to see the labels**
