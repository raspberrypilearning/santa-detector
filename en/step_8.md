## What next?

Other stuff to try:

- Make the background flash 
- Animate the sprite using costumes
- Change the sound ('Santa Claus is coming to town' would be good!) 
- Use different graphic effects instead of `change size`
- Display a message 
- Build a support or stand for the PIR module
