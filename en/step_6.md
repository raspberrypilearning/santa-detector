## Challenge: adding more actions

--- challenge ---
There are lots of other things you could try and add to your program:
- Make the background flash
- Animate the sprite using costumes
- Change the sound (‘Santa Claus is coming to town’ would be good!)
- Use different graphic effects instead of change size
- Display a message
- Build a support or stand for the PIR sensor
