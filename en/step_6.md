## Detecting Santa

Now that you are ready, having tested your PIR Motion Sensor and having created your Santa sprite, it is time to write your program.

Here is the basic idea of your algorithm:
  - When the flag is clicked `forever`{.blockcontrol}
  - Check to see if gpio 4 is high
  - If it is:
    - Show your sprite
	- Set it's size to fill the screen
	- Play a loud noise
	- Reduce it's size back to normal
  - If it isn't:
    - Hide the sprite
	
- Now create this algorithm in Scratch. If you don't know how to use sounds in Scratch, then have a look at the section below. If you get really stuck you can use the hints.
