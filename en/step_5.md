## Set up the detector in your room!

--- task ---
1. On Christmas Eve, set up your Pi with the sensor pointing at your bedroom door.

1. Connect your Pi to a huge speaker.

1. Make sure the sensor does not detect you in bed, otherwise you will get false positives: the alarm will go off every time you move!

1. Go to sleep.

1. Wake up when Santa comes in and feed him mince pies and sherry.

**Disclaimer:** we cannot guarantee that this alarm will not scare Santa off so that you get no presents at all, not even a wrinkled satsuma in an old sock.
