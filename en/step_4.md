## Testing your motion sensor

You will need to test that your Raspberry Pi is able to listen to the PIR motion sensor, so that it can find out when motion is detected.

- Start the Scratch 2 application to begin testing.

[[[rpi-scratch-opening]]]

- Enable the Pi GPIO extension in Scratch 2.

[[[rpi-scratch-add-pi-gpio]]]

- Now use the section below to write a small script to test that your Raspberry Pi is detecting motion.
