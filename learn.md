By creating a Santa detector with your Raspberry Pi you will learn:

- how to connect a passive infra-red (PIR) sensor to the Raspberry Pi
- how to control the flow of your Scratch program by responding to the input from the sensor.

This resource covers elements from the following strands of the [Raspberry Pi Digital Making Curriculum](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/):

- [Use basic programming constructs to create simple programs](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/programming/creator)
- [Use basic digital, analogue, and electromechanical components](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/physical-computing/creator)
